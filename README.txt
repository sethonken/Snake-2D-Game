To start the game, go to "Release" -> "Snake"

In this game, the player controls a snake in a square grid by using the arrow keys, WASD, or number pad.
The objective is to eat a mouse and increase in size, earning as most points as possible. The game ends
when the snake runs into itself.

The square grid is open-border, which means that exiting on the right side will spawn the snake on the left
side. Each time the snake increases in size, it moves a little faster.
